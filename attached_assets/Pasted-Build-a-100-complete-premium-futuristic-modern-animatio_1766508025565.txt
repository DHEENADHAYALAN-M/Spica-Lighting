Build a 100% complete, premium, futuristic, modern, animation-rich website for a lighting company named “Spica Lighting”.

This website must feel HIGH-END, TRENDY, VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE, and USER-FRIENDLY, with a strong LIGHT-BULB and LIGHT-BEAM theme. It should look like a top-tier modern brand website, similar in experience quality to an e-commerce website, but without online payments.

The website must be fully functional end-to-end and ready for real users.
