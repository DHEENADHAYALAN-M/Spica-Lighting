IMPORTANT:
Rebuild ONLY the “Product Catalogue” section shown on the Products page.
Do NOT change any other section, layout, styling, routing, navbar, footer, animations, deployment config, or existing functionality outside this section.

STRICT SCOPE:
- Modify ONLY the Product Catalogue section UI and logic.
- Keep page spacing, fonts, colors, background, and theme exactly the same.
- Do NOT remove or alter global styles, Tailwind config, or animations elsewhere.

========================
ASSETS UPDATE (CRITICAL)
========================

1. REMOVE ONLY THE FOLLOWING ASSETS:
- Remove the current product images related to:
  - Lights
  - Switches
(These are the images currently used inside the Product Catalogue section.)

2. ADD NEW PRODUCT IMAGES:
- Generate NEW premium, modern, professional product images for:
  - Lighting Solutions
  - Switches & Smart Switches
- Images should feel:
  - Architectural
  - Commercial-grade
  - High-end B2B lighting brand
- Add these new images into the existing `assets` folder.
- Organize clearly (example):
  - assets/lights/
  - assets/switches/

3. DO NOT TOUCH THESE ASSETS:
- Background images
- Logo / favicon
- Project images
- UI textures
- Any other images used outside Product Catalogue

========================
SECTION REBUILD RULES
========================

4. REMOVE COMPLETELY:
- Remove brochure / catalogue download cards
- Remove PDF icons
- Remove “Lighting Brochure” and “Switches Catalogue”
- Remove ALL filter options including “ALL”

5. KEEP ONLY TWO PRODUCT CATEGORIES:
- Lighting Solutions
- Switches & Smart Switches

These two should appear as the ONLY selectable tabs or buttons.

6. INTERACTION BEHAVIOR:
- When “Lighting Solutions” is active:
  - Display ONLY lighting product images and details
- When “Switches & Smart Switches” is active:
  - Display ONLY switch product images and details
- Default active category: Lighting Solutions

7. PRODUCT DISPLAY (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Products must be displayed in a SINGLE HORIZONTAL ROW
- This row acts as a carousel / slider
- Images must loop infinitely (no end)

8. CAROUSEL DESIGN:
- Center image:
  - Bigger than others
  - Brighter
  - Fully opaque
  - Slight emphasis (scale or clarity)
- Side images:
  - Slightly smaller
  - Slightly dimmed
- Smooth animated transitions when sliding

9. NAVIGATION:
- Add PREVIOUS and NEXT arrow buttons on left and right
- Buttons must match existing gold + black theme
- Clicking arrows moves carousel one item at a time

10. PRODUCT CARD CONTENT:
Each product must show:
- Product image
- Product name
- Short professional description
- Category label (Lighting / Switches)

NO pricing  
NO add-to-cart  
NO forms  

11. UX QUALITY:
- Smooth transitions
- Premium, modern, professional feel
- Fully responsive
- Keyboard & click friendly

12. DATA HANDLING:
- Use the NEWLY CREATED product images
- Structure products so more items can be added easily later
- No backend
- No database
- No API calls
