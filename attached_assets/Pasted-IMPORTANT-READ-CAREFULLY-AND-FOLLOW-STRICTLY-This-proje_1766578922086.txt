IMPORTANT – READ CAREFULLY AND FOLLOW STRICTLY

This project does NOT require a database.
There must be NO PostgreSQL, NO Drizzle ORM usage, and NO database initialization at any point.

================================
DATABASE REMOVAL (LOCKED)
================================

STOP AND REVERT THE FOLLOWING COMPLETELY:
- Do NOT create or connect to any database
- Do NOT run db:push
- Do NOT require DATABASE_URL
- Do NOT fetch product, image, or UI data from backend APIs
- Do NOT block UI rendering based on database availability

PROJECT INTENT (LOCKED):
- This is a frontend-driven, static B2B lighting website
- Products, images, and content must be rendered directly from static data
- Backend (Express) exists ONLY to serve the frontend and optional empty API stubs
- UI must NEVER depend on database state or backend data

REQUIRED DATABASE ACTIONS:
1. Disable or bypass all database initialization logic
2. Stub or safely ignore any database-related imports
3. Ensure no runtime errors occur when DATABASE_URL is missing
4. Application must run fully with ZERO database configured

================================
FIX MISSING IMAGES – NO DATABASE
================================

The images for the following sections are NOT rendering correctly:
- Lighting Solutions
- Switches & Automation

CAUSE:
These images are currently sourced from database-backed or dynamic data, which must be removed.

REQUIRED IMAGE FIX (STRICT):
1. Do NOT use any database, API, hooks, or backend calls to load images
2. Replace ALL dynamic image references with static paths or static imports
3. Images must be loaded directly from the assets folder only

ASSET USAGE RULES:
- Lighting Solutions images must come from:
  assets/lights/
- Switches & Automation images must come from:
  assets/switches/

Example (conceptual only):
- Lighting image → "/assets/lights/light-1.png"
- Switch image → "/assets/switches/switch-1.png"

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- All <img> tags must receive valid static src paths
- Images must render even if the backend is completely offline
- Text, layout, spacing, animations, and theme must remain EXACTLY the same

================================
STRICT CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT BREAK)
================================

- Do NOT change routing
- Do NOT change Vite or Vercel build configuration
- Do NOT change layout, spacing, typography, or animations
- Do NOT introduce new backend complexity
- Do NOT modify any other sections of the website

================================
FINAL STATE REQUIRED
================================

- Application runs with ZERO database
- No DATABASE_URL required
- No db:push
- Lighting Solutions image renders correctly
- Switches & Automation image renders correctly
- Product catalogue behaves correctly
- Visual output matches both local and Vercel preview
