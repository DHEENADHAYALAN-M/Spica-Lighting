You are working on a monorepo project with this structure:

- client/ → Vite + React frontend
- server/ → Node/Express backend
- shared/ → shared code between frontend and backend

The frontend is deployed to Vercel using Vite.
The backend is NOT deployed to Vercel.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
The Vercel build fails because frontend files inside `client/` import from `@shared/routes`,
and that shared file contains backend/server-only code (Express routes or Node logic).
Vite cannot bundle server-only code for the browser.

GOAL:
Fix the project so the frontend build works on Vercel WITHOUT breaking the backend.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT remove or modify backend functionality.
- Do NOT remove the `shared/` folder.
- Do NOT introduce a database.
- Do NOT convert the project to Next.js.
- Keep the existing project structure.
- Only move or duplicate shared logic if required.
- The frontend must ONLY import browser-safe code.

TASKS TO PERFORM:

1. INSPECT `shared/routes.ts` (or any file imported as `@shared/routes`).
   - If it contains Express routes, server handlers, or Node-only imports,
     DO NOT allow frontend code to import it directly.

2. CREATE a new frontend-safe shared file:
   - Path: `shared/frontend-routes.ts`
   - This file must contain ONLY plain objects, constants, enums, or types.
   - NO Express, NO Node APIs.

   Example content:
export const PRODUCT_CATEGORIES = {
lights: "Lights",
switches: "Switches",
};

Copy code

3. UPDATE frontend imports:
- Replace all frontend imports of:
  `@shared/routes`
- With:
  `@shared/frontend-routes`

4. ENSURE the backend still imports from the original `shared/routes.ts`
without any changes.

5. VERIFY `vite.config.ts`:
- Must include aliases:
  ```
  "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "client/src"),
  "@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "shared"),
  ```
- Do NOT include server-only plugins.
- `root` must be `client`
- `build.outDir` must be `dist`

6. ENSURE the frontend has NO imports from:
- `express`
- `fs`
- `path`
- `process`
- backend route handlers
- database logic

7. DO NOT change package.json scripts unless absolutely required.

EXPECTED RESULT:
- `npm run dev:client` works locally.
- `npm run build` succeeds.
- Vercel build passes without Rollup errors.
- Frontend remains fully functional.
- Backend remains intact and untouched.

Proceed carefully and apply only the required changes.
