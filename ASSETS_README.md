# Image Assets Guide

All images used in the website are stored in `/client/public/assets/`. To modify images, simply replace the files in this directory.

## Image Files

- **logo.png** - Company logo (used in header and favicon)
- **hero-bg.png** - Hero section background image
- **lighting-card.jpg** - Lighting Solutions category card
- **switches-card.jpg** - Switches & Automation category card
- **about-image.jpg** - About page feature image
- **project-luxury-hotel.jpg** - Featured project: Luxury Hotel
- **project-corporate-office.jpg** - Featured project: Corporate Office
- **project-smart-home.jpg** - Featured project: Smart Home

## How to Replace Images

1. Navigate to `/client/public/assets/`
2. Replace any image file with your new image of the same name
3. The website will automatically use the new image on next refresh
4. Ensure images are properly optimized for web (jpg for photos, png for logos/transparent images)

## Image Recommendations

- **Logo**: Square format, PNG with transparency, minimum 256x256px
- **Hero Background**: Wide aspect ratio (16:9), 1400x800px or larger
- **Category Cards**: Landscape orientation, 800x600px or similar
- **Project Images**: Landscape or vertical, 800px wide minimum
- **About Image**: Square or portrait, 600x600px minimum

## Note

Images should be placed directly in the `/client/public/assets/` folder. The website references them using the path `/assets/filename.ext`.
